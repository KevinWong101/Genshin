      <h1>Adventuring and Plot</h1>
        <p>In Genshin Impact you can equip weapons and artifacts in order to help improve your character stats. You can also level up your characters with Exp. Books which can help improve your characters stats. You can also have a party of 4 characters but if you play with a a couple of your friends, you can only run 1 character. The story is interesting and the side missions help you explore the entire map, good thing there are teleport points which you can claim around the map to help save you the trouble of walking around.</p>

      <h1>Fighting</h1>
        <p>The fighting in Genshin Impact is simple and effective. With elemental combos that have a reaction depending on which element you use, you can dish out massive amounts of damage. You can switch up combo's by switching inbetween characters mid-battle in order to create a elemental reaction. You can also switch it up by going on a range offensive or going into combat with a melee weapon.</p>
